# Coprime Validator

## Description

Write a program to determine if the two given numbers are coprime. A pair of numbers are coprime if their greatest shared factor is `1`.

The inputs will always be two positive integers between `2` and `99`.

## Examples

`20` and `27`:

* Factors of `20`: `1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20`
* Factors of `27`: `1, 3, 9, 27`
* Greatest shared factor: `1`
* Result: `20` and `27` **are** coprime

`12` and `39`:

* Factors of `12`: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12`
* Factors of `39`: `1, 3, 13, 39`
* Greatest shared factor: `3`
* Result: `12` and `39` **are not** coprimes
