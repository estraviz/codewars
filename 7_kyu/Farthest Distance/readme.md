# Farthest Distance

## Description

You are given a array which contains sub-arrays. Each sub-array represents a point in a (2d) cartesian coordinate system.

Create a function which returns the distance of the two points which are farthest apart.

All distances are to be rounded to 2 decimal places. If the array contains two points return the distance between them. There will always be at least two points.

```python
furthestDistance([[1,2], [3,8], [4,3]]) // returns 6.32
```

Distances between

[1,2] [3,8] => 6.32

[3,8] [4,3] => 5.10

[1,2] [4,3] => 3.16
