# sort array by last character

## Description

Sort array by last character

Complete the function to sort a given array or list by last character of elements.

Element can be an integer or a string.

### Example

```python
['acvd', 'bcc']  -->  ['bcc', 'acvd']
```

The last characters of the strings are `d` and `c`. As `c` comes before `d`, sorting by last character will give `['bcc', 'acvd']`.

If two elements don't differ in the last character, then they should be sorted by the order they come in the array.
