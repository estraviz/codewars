# JavaScript Array Filter

## Description

In Python, there is a built-in filter function that operates similarly to JS's filter. For more information on how to use this function, visit [https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter)

The solution would work like the following:

```python
get_even_numbers([2,4,5,6]) => [2,4,6]
```
