# Unique string characters

## Description

In this Kata, you will be given two strings `a` and `b` and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings.

For example:

```python
solve("xyab","xzca") = "ybzc"
--The first string has 'yb' which is not in the second string.
--The second string has 'zc' which is not in the first string.
```

Notice also that you return the characters from the first string concatenated with those from the second string.

More examples in the tests cases.

Good luck!
