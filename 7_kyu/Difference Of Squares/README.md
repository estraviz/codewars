# Difference Of Squares

## Description

Recreation of [Project Euler problem #6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first `n` natural numbers `(1 <= n <= 100)` and the square of their sum.

### Example

For example, when `n = 10`:

* The square of the sum of the numbers is:

(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

* The sum of the squares of the numbers is:
12 + 22 + 32 + 42 + 52 + 62 + 72 + 82 + 92 + 102 = 385

Hence the difference between square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of those numbes is: 3025 - 385 = 2640.
