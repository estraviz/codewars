# Find the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation

Implement function which will return sum of roots of a quadratic equation rounded to 2 decimal places, if there are any possible roots. Otherwise return None/null/nil/nothing. If you use discriminant,when discriminant = 0, x1 = x2 = root => return sum of both roots. There will always be valid arguments.
