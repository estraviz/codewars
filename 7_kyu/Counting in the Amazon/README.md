# Counting in the Amazon

## Description

The Arara are an isolated tribe found in the Amazon who count in pairs. For example one to eight is as follows:

1 = anane
2 = adak
3 = adak anane
4 = adak adak
5 = adak adak anane
6 = adak adak adak
7 = adak adak adak anane
8 = adak adak adak adak

Take a given number and return the Arara's equivalent.

e.g.

```python
count_arara(3) # -> 'adak anane'
count_arara(8) # -> 'adak adak adak adak'
```
