# All Star Code Challenge #22

## Description

Create a function that takes an integer argument of seconds and converts the value into a string describing how many hours and minutes comprise that many seconds.

Any remaining seconds left over are ignored.

Note:
The string output needs to be in the specific form - "X hour(s) and X minute(s)"

For example:

```python
3600 --> "1 hour(s) and 0 minute(s)"
3601 --> "1 hour(s) and 0 minute(s)"
3500 --> "0 hour(s) and 58 minute(s)"
23500 --> "89 hour(s) and 51 minute(s)"
```
