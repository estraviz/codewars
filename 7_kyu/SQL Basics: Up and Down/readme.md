# SQL Basics: Up and Down

## Description

Given a table of random numbers as follows:

**`numbers table schema`**

* `id`
* `number1`
* `number2`

Your job is to return table with similar structure and headings, where if the sum of a column is odd, the column shows the minimum value for that column, and when the sum is even, it shows the max value. You must use a `CASE` statement.

**`output table schema `**

* `number1`
* `number2`
