# Return String of First Characters

In this exercise, a string is passed to a method and a new string has to be returned with the first character of each word in the string.

For example:

```python
"This Is A Test" ==> "TIAT"
```

Strings will only contain letters and spaces, with exactly 1 space between words, and no leading/trailing spaces.
