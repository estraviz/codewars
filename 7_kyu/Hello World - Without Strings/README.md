# Hello World - Without Strings

## Description

You need to create a function, `helloWorld`, that will return the String `Hello, World!` without actually using raw strings. This includes quotes, double quotes and template strings. You can, however, use the `String` constructor and any related functions.

You cannot use the following:

```python
"Hello, World!"
'Hello, World!'
`Hello, World!`
```

Good luck and try to be as creative as possible!
