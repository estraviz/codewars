# Pair Zeros

## Description

For a given list of digits `0` to `9`, return a list with the same digits in the same order, but with all `0`s paired. Pairing two `0`s generates one `0` at the location of the first one.

## Examples

```python
input: [0, 1, 0, 2]
paired: ^-----^
    -> [0, 1,   2]
  kept: ^

input: [0, 1, 0, 0]
paired: ^-----^
    -> [0, 1,    0]
  kept: ^        ^

input: [1, 0, 7, 0, 1]
paired:    ^-----^
    -> [1, 0, 7,    1]
  kept:    ^

input: [0, 1, 7, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0]
paired: ^--------^        ^--^
    -> [0, 1, 7,    2, 2, 0,    1, 0]
  kept: ^                 ^        ^
```

## Notes

* Pairing happens from left to right. For each pairing, the second `0` will always be paired towards the first ( right to left )
* `0`s generated by pairing can NOT be paired again
* ( void where not applicable: ) Don't modify the input array or you may fail to pass the tests
