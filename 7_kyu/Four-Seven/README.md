# Four/Seven

## Description

Simple kata, simple rules: your function should accept the inputs `4` and `7`. If `4` is entered, the function should return `7`. If `7` is entered, the function should return `4`. Anything else entered as input should return a false-y value such as `False`, `0`, `[]`, `""`. There's only one catch, your function cannot include if statements (or the eval function due to the fact that you can get around the if requirement using it).

There are some _very_ simple ways of answering this problem, but I encourage you to try and be as creative as possible.

Good Luck!
