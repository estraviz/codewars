# Mr Martingale

## Description

You're in the casino, playing Roulette, going for the "1-18" bets only and desperate to beat the house and so you want to test how effective the [Martingale strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)) is.

You will be given a starting cash balance and an array of binary digits to represent a win (`1`) or a loss (`0`). Return your balance after playing all rounds.

_The Martingale strategy_

You start with a stake of 100 dollars. If you lose a round, you lose the stake placed on that round and you double the stake for your next bet. When you win, you win 100% of the stake and revert back to staking 100 dollars on your next bet.

## Example

```python
martingale(1000, [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]) === 1300
```

Explanation:

* you win your 1st round: gain $100, balance = 1100
* you win the 2nd round: gain $100, balance = 1200
* you lose the 3rd round: lose $100 dollars, balance = 1100
* double stake for 4th round and lose: staked $200, lose $200, balance = 900
* double stake for 5th round and win: staked $400, won $400, balance = 1300

**Note: Your balance is allowed to go below 0.**
