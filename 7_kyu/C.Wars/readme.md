# C.Wars

## Description

Normally we have firstname, middle and the last name but there may be more than one word in a name like a South Indian one.

Similar to those kinda names we need to initialize the names.

See the pattern below

```python
initials('code wars') => returns C.Wars
initials('Barack Hussain obama') => returns B.H.Obama
```

Complete the function initials.
