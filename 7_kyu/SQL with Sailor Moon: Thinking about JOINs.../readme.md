# SQL with Sailor Moon: Thinking about JOINs

## Description

Practise some SQL fundamentals by making a simple database on a topic you feel familiar with. Or use mine, populated with a wealth of Sailor Moon trivia.

**`sailorsenshi schema`**

* `id`
* `senshi_name`
* `real_name_jpn`
* `school_id`
* `cat_id`

**`cats schema`**

* `id`
* `name`

**`schools schema`**

* `id`
* `school`

Return a results table - `sailor_senshi`, `real_name`, `cat` and `school` - of all characters, containing each character's high school, their civilian name and the cat who introduced them to their magical crime-fighting destiny.

Keep in mind some senshi were not initiated by a cat guardian and one is not in high school. The field can be left blank if this is the case.
