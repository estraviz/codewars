# Stones on the Table

## Description

There are some stones on Bob's table in a row, and each of them can be red, green or blue, indicated by the characters `R`, `G`, and `B`.

Help Bob find the minimum number of stones he needs to remove from the table so that the stones in each pair of adjacent stones have different colours.

Examples:

```python
"RGBRGBRGGB"   => 1
"RGGRGBBRGRR"  => 3
"RRRRGGGGBBBB" => 9
```
