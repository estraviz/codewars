# SpeedCode #2 - Array Madness

## Description

Given two integer arrays `a, b`, both of `length >= 1`, create a program that returns `True` if the sum of the squares of each element in `a` is strictly greater than the sum of the cubes of each element in `b`.

### Example

```python
array_madness([4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3]) => True #because 4 ** 2 + 5 ** 2 + 6 ** 2 > 1 ** 3 + 2 ** 3 + 3 ** 3
```
