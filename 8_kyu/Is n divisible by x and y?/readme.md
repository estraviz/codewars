# Is n divisible by x and y

## Description

Create a function `isDivisible(n, x, y)` that checks if a number `n` is divisible by two numbers `x` AND `y`. All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

Example:

```python
is_divisible(3, 1, 3) --> True because 3 is divisible by 1 and 3
is_divisible(12, 2, 6) --> True because 12 is divisible by 2 and 6
is_divisible(100, 5, 3) --> False because 100 is not divisible by 3
is_divisible(12, 7, 5) --> False because 12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5
```
