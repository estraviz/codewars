# For Twins: 1. Types

## Description

This kata series was created for friends of mine who just started to learn programming. Wish you all the best and keep your mind open and sharp!

### Task

Write a function that will accept two parameters: `variable` and `type` and check if type of `variable` is matching `type`. Return `True` if types match or `False` if not.

### Examples

```markdown
42, "int"    --> True
"42", "int"  --> False
````
