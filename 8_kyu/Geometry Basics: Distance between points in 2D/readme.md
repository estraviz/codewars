# Geometry Basics: Distance between points in 2D

## Description

This series of katas will introduce you to basics of doing geometry with computers.

`Point` objects have `x` and `y` attributes (`X` and `Y` in `C#`) attributes.

Write a function calculating distance between `Point a` and `Point b`.

Tests round answers to 6 decimal places.
