# Abbreviate a Two Word Name

## Description

Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

The output should be two capital letters with a dot seperating them.

It should look like this:

```python
Sam Harris => S.H
Patrick Feeney => P.F
```
