#  Thinkful - Number Drills: Blue and red marbles

### Description:
You and a friend have decided to play a game to drill your statistical intuitions. The game works like this:

You have a bunch of red and blue marbles. To start the game you grab a handful of marbles of each color and put them into the bag, keeping track of how many of each color go in. You take turns reaching into the bag, guessing a color, and then pulling one marble out. You get a point if you guessed correctly. The trick is you only have three seconds to make your guess, so you have to think quickly.

You've decided to write a function, `guess_blue()` to help automatically calculate whether you should guess "blue" or "red". The function should take four arguments:

* the number of blue marbles you put in the bag to start
* the number of red marbles you put in the bag to start
* the number of blue marbles pulled out so far, and
* the number of red marbles pulled out so far.

`guess_blue()` should return the probability of drawing a blue marble, expressed as a float. For example, `guess_blue(5, 5, 2, 3)` should return `0.6`.
