# DNA to RNA Conversion

[Deoxyribonucleic acid](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Deoxyribonucleic-Acid-DNA), DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases [Guanine](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/guanine) (`'G'`), [Cytosine](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Cytosine) (`'C'`), [Adenine](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Adenine) (`'A'`), and [Thymine](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Thymine) (`'T'`).

[Ribonucleic acid](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Ribonucleic-Acid-RNA), RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid [Uracil](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Uracil) (`'U'`).

Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.

For example:

```markdown
"GCAT" => "GCAU"
```

The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of `'G'`, `'C'`, `'A'` and/or `'T'`.
