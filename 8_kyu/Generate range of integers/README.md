# Generate range of integers

## Description

Implement a function named generateRange(min, max, step), which takes three arguments and generates a range of integers from min to max, with the step. The first integer is the minimum value, the second is the maximum of the range and the third is the step. (min < max)

## Task

Implement a function named

```python
generateRange(2, 10, 2) // should return iterator of [2,4,6,8,10]
generateRange(1, 10, 3) // should return iterator of [1,4,7,10]
```

## Note

* min < max
* step > 0
* the range does not HAVE to include max (depending on the step)
