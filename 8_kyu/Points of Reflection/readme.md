# Points of Reflection

## Description

_Point reflection_ or _point symmetry_ is a basic concept in geometry where a given point, P, at a given position relative to a mid-point, Q has a corresponding point, P1, which is the same distance from Q but in the opposite direction.

## Task

Given two points P and Q, output the symmetric point of point P about Q. Each argument is a two-element array of integers representing the point's X and Y coordinates. Output should be in the same format, giving the X and Y coordinates of point P1. You do not have to validate the input.
