# Are You Playing Banjo

Create a function which answers the question _"Are you playing banjo?"_.
If your name starts with the letter `"R"` or lower case `"r"`, you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

```markdown
name + " plays banjo"
name + " does not play banjo"
```

Names given are always valid strings.
