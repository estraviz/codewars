# Sum of differences in array

## Description

Your task is to sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in descending order.

### Example

```markdown
[2, 1, 10]  -->  9

# In descending order: [10, 2, 1]

Sum: (10 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 8 + 1 = 9
```

If the array is empty or the array has only one element the result should be `0` (Nothing in Haskell, None in Rust).
