# Byte me!

## Introduction

If I were to ask you the size of `"hello"`, what would you say?

Wait, let me rephrase the question:

If I were to ask you the total byte size of `"hello"`, how many bytes do you think it takes up?

I'll give you a hint: it's not 5.

```markdown
len("hello")  -->  5
byte size -->  54
```

54? What?!

Here's why: every string has to have an encoding (e.g ASCII),the info that makes it an object, as well as all of it's other properites... it would have to take up a bit more than 5 bytes, wouldn't it?

This might be useful for sending something over a network, where you need to represent the memory size the item takes up.

## Task

In this kata, you need to return the number of bytes (aka. memory size) a given object takes up.

Different variable types will be given, but they will all be valid. Also, random generation for strings takes out of Unicode, not the regular 255 ascii letters.

_p.s: Don't be afraid to use the internet. It "byte" come in handy :)_

Other Examples:

```markdown
Object    Bytes    Why?
----      ----     ----
"é¾˜"       76      Other character sets take up more room.
123        28      Numbers don't have as much info in them.
[1,2]      72      Lists have more info stored (e.g index).
(1,2)      56      Tuples are (kind of) just bowls of data.
```
