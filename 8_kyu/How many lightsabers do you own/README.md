# How many lightsabers do you own?

Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function that

- accepts the name of a programmer, and
- returns the number of lightsabers owned by that person.

The only person who owns lightsabers is `Zach`, by the way. He owns `18`, which is an awesome number of lightsabers. Anyone else owns `0`.

For example (**Input --> Output**):

```rust
"anyone else" --> 0
"Zach" --> 18
```
