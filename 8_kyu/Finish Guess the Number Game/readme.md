# Finish Guess the Number Game

## Description

Imagine you are creating a game where the user has to guess the correct number. But there is a limit of how many guesses the user can do.

* If the user tries to guess WRONG more than the limit the function should throw an error
* If the user guess wrong it should lose a life and return false (if you guess correctly you shouldn't remove a life)
* If the user guess right it should return true

Can you finish the game so all the rules are met?
