# Register for the Party (SQL for Beginners #3)

## Description

You received an invitation to an amazing party. Now you need to write an insert statement to add yourself to the table of `participants`.

**`participants table schema`**

* `name` (string)
* `age` (integer)
* `attending` (boolean)

NOTES:

* Since alcohol will be served, you can only attend if you are 21 or older
* You can't attend if the attending column returns anything but true
* Don't remove the 'SELECT' command from the solution!
