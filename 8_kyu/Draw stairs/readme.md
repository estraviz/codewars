# Draw stairs

## Description

Given a number n, draw stairs with 'I' n tall and n wide, with the tallest in the top left. Example (with - to represent spaces; DO NOT USE THEM IN THE SOLUTIONS! USE SPACES IN SOLUTION! the "-"s are for clarity.): `draw_stairs(3) == '''I\n_I\n__I'''`

For example, a 7-step stairs should be drawn like this:

```python
const sevenStepStairs = drawStairs(7)
```

```python
I
 I
  I
   I
    I
     I
      I
```
