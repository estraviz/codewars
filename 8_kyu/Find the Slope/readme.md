# Find the Slope

## Description

Given an array of 4 integers `[a, b, c, d]` representing two points `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, return a string representation of the slope of the line joining these two points.

For an undefined slope (division by 0), return `undefined`. Note that the "undefined" is case-sensitive.

```python
   a:x1
   b:y1
   c:x2
   d:y2
```

Assume that `[a, b, c, d]` and the answer are all integers (no floating numbers!). Slope: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope)
