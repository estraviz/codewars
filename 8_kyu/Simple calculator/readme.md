# Simple calculator

## Description

You are required to create a simple calculator that returns thzshe result of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division of two numbers.

Your function will accept three arguments:

* The first and second argument will be numbers.
* The third argument will represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.

**Example:**

```python
calculator(1, 2, '+') => 3
```

if the variables are not numbers or the sign does not belong to the list above a message "unknown value" must be returned.

**Example:**

```python
calculator(1, 2, '$') # result will be "unknown value"
```

Good luck!
