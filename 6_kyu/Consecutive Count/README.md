# Consecutive Count

## Description

I want to know the size of the longest consecutive elements of X in Y. You will receive two arguments: `items` and `key`. Return the length of the longest segment of consecutive `keys` in the given `items`.

### Notes

* The items and the key will be either an integer or a string.
* If the key does not appear in the items, return `0`.

### Examples

```python
90000, 0           -->  4
"abcdaaadse", "a"  -->  3
"abcdaaadse", "z"  -->  0
```
