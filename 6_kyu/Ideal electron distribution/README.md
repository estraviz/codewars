# Ideal electron distribution

## Description

You are a scientist and you decided to play with electron distribution among atom's shells. You know that basic idea of electron distribution is that electrons should fill a shell untill it's holding the maximum number of electrons.

Rules:

* Maximum number of electrons in a shell is distributed with a rule of 2n^2 (n being position of a shell).
* For example, maximum number of electrons in 3rd shield is 2*3^2 = 18.
* Electrons should fill the lowest level shell first.
* If the electrons have completely filled the lowest level shell, the other unoccupied electrons will fill the higher level shell and so on.
