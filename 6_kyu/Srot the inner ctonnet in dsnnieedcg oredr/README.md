# Srot the inner ctonnet in dsnnieedcg oredr

## Description

You have to sort the inner content of every word of a string in descending order.
The inner content is the content of a word without first and the last char.

Some examples:

```python
"sort the inner content in descending order" -> "srot the inner ctonnet in dsnnieedcg oredr"
"wait for me" -> "wiat for me"
"this kata is easy" -> "tihs ktaa is esay"
```

The string will never be null and will never be empty.
It will contain only lowercase-letters and whitespaces.

In C++ the string is always 0-terminated.
