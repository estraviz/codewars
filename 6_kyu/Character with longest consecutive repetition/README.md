## Description

For a given string `s` find the character `c` (or `C`) with longest consecutive repetition and return:

```python
(c, l)
```

where `l` (or `L`) is the length of the repetition. If there are two or more characters with the same `l` return the first in order of appearance.

For empty string return:

```python

```

Happy coding! :)
