# String average

## Description

You are given a string of numbers between 0-9. Find the average of these numbers and return it as a floored whole number (ie: no decimal places) written out as a string. Eg:

```python
"zero nine five two" -> "four"
```

If the string is empty or includes a number greater than 9, return "n/a"
