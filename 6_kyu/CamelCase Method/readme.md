# CamelCase Method

## Description

Write simple .camelCase method (`camel_case` function in PHP, `CamelCase` in C# or `camelCase` in Java) for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

For instance:

```python
camelcase("hello case") => HelloCase
camelcase("camel case word") => CamelCaseWord
```
