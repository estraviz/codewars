# +1 Array

## Description

Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

* the array can't be empty;
* only non-negative, single digit integers are allowed.

Return `nil` (or your language's equivalent) for invalid inputs.

## Examples

For example the array `[2, 3, 9]` equals `239`, adding one would return the array `[2, 4, 0]`.

`[4, 3, 2, 5]` would return `[4, 3, 2, 6]`.
