# Compare powers

## Description

You certainly can tell which is the larger number between 2<sup>10</sup> and 2<sup>15</sup>.

But what about, say, 2<sup>10</sup> and 3<sup>10</sup>? You know this one too.

Things tend to get a bit more complicated with both different bases and exponents: which is larger between 3<sup>9</sup> and 5<sup>6</sup>?

Well, by now you have surely guessed that you have to build a function to compare powers, returning `-1` if the first member is larger, `0` if they are equal, `1` otherwise; powers to compare will be provided in the `[base, exponent]` format:

```python
compare_powers([2, 10], [2, 15]) == 1
compare_powers([2, 10], [3, 10]) == 1
compare_powers([2, 10], [2, 10]) == 0
compare_powers([3, 9], [5, 6]) == -1
compare_powers([7, 7], [5, 8]) == -1
```

Only positive integers will be tested, incluing bigger numbers - you are warned now, so be diligent try to implement an efficient solution not to drain too much on CW resources ;)!
