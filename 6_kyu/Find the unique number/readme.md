# Find the unique number

## Description

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

```python
find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55
```

It’s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
