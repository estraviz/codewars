# Is a number prime

## Description

Define a function `isPrime`/`is_prime()` that takes one integer argument and returns `true`/`True` or `false`/`False` depending on if the integer is a prime.

Per Wikipedia, a prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Example

```python
bool isPrime(5) = return true
```

### Assumptions

* You can assume you will be given an integer input.
* You can not assume that the integer will be only positive. You may be given negative numbers as well (or 0).
