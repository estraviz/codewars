# Numericals of a String

## Description

You are given an input string.

For each symbol in the string if it's the first character occurence, replace it with a '1', else replace it with the amount of times you've already seen it...

But will your code be **performant enough**?

Examples:

```python
input   =  "Hello, World!"
result  =  "1112111121311"

input   =  "aaaaaaaaaaaa"
result  =  "123456789101112"
```

There might be some non-ascii characters in the string.
